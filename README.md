# Set-translator-s-time
WE have an international conference and we need some translators for tranlating spokesman speeches but there is a problem.
tranlators are very busy in another places and they can't be in conference fulltime . 
so we should know the free time of each translator and the languages that he know .
This conference has some events and we need some translators for each event.
we should enter the events and the languages those we need for that special event and free times of each translator.
this application gives us the most appropriate plan for set translators .
